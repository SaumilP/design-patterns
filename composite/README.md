# Composite Pattern

## 📋 Overview

This folder contains the **Composite** design pattern implementation.

---

## 🎯 Intent

The composite pattern solves a specific structural or behavioral problem in software design by providing reusable solutions.

---

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities

This pattern involves multiple roles working together to achieve separation of concerns and flexibility.

---

## 💡 Code Example

Please see the `src/` directory for complete, executable code examples demonstrating this pattern.

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

### Advantages ✅
- Provides structured solution
- Promotes code reusability
- Improves maintainability

### Disadvantages ❌
- May add complexity
- Performance overhead
- Learning curve

---

## 🚫 When NOT to Use

- For simple scenarios where direct solutions suffice
- When performance is critical and overhead is unacceptable
- In situations where the pattern doesn't naturally fit

---

## ⚠️ Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Issue | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Overuse | Using pattern unnecessarily | Apply YAGNI principle |
| Misapplication | Wrong context for pattern | Study pattern requirements |
| Complexity | Pattern makes code harder | Simplify or choose different pattern |

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

This pattern appears frequently in:
- Enterprise applications
- Framework and library design
- System integration scenarios

---

## 🔗 Alternatives & Similar Patterns

- Other structural/behavioral patterns
- Simpler direct approaches
- Complementary patterns

---

## 📝 Best Practices

1. Understand the problem before applying the pattern
2. Document your pattern usage clearly
3. Keep implementations simple
4. Test thoroughly
5. Consider performance implications
6. Review periodically for improvements
7. Teach team members about the pattern
8. Refactor if pattern no longer applies
