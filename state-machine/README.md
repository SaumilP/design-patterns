Finite State Machine Design Pattern
==================================
One of the handy design pattern - specially when requirement arises to start processing
from any given state. Because this pattern is hybrid - combining State Design Pattern, Composite
or Decorator & Factory Pattern - it makes it possible to compose actions in individual state.

> In this module very small rudimentary example has been taken to provide clear understanding of the pattern.
